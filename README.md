# Documentation

This repository contains code to check whether a certain class of parameters considered in [Navjeevan, Pinto, and Santos (2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05311) -- roughly, those considered in Corollary 4.4 of the paper. Conditional on being identified, the code also implements the estimator proposed in Section 5 of the paper, reporting both point estimates and standard errors. The two code files in the repository are:

1. `check_identified.R`: This file contains code to check whether the parameters of interest are identified based on the conditions outlined in Corollary 4.4 of the paper and estimate them if they are identified.

2. `check_identified_test.R`: This file contains some example code to illustrate how to use the functions in `check_identified.R`.
